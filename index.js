Greetings, ladies and gentlemen! 

Iâ€™m a creative problem solver eager to implement solutions to many issues foreseen in our modern society. In addition to that, I am also a big advocate for giving back to others who aspire to follow a path like mine.

I currently work at Intel Corporation in the Datacenter AI group as a Platform Applications Engineer. I provide technical support and expertise for Intel server CPUs and server board design development for customers such as Facebook, Google, Amazon Web Services, etc.
